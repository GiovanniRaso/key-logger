# key-logger
*This was only made for educational purposes only*

I did this project to help get a deeper understanding of cybersecurity and the common attacks to get one's information. I decided to use Python because there is a library that has the tools needed for a key logger to work. This is only in a basic stage but I want to in the future understand how this is programmed to automatically be downloaded online.
